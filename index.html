<h1>Problem 1</h1>

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.<br>
<i>Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.</i>

<h1>Problem 2</h1>

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... <br>
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, <i>find the sum of the even-valued terms.</i>
